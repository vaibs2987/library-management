# library-management
This library-management project has been build using Spring boot.

In this project I have not used any database to hold the data.

So if we want to use database then only changes has to be done in all repository classes.

Also I have written one aspect to check the credinals, same way it can be applied to all other methods.

Also for handling exception across the whole container, I have written one aspect to catch exception across the container.
